# Sensor OS

This system, based on the [Nitrogen OS](https://github.com/nitrogen-project), provides secondary display and control for Android devices connected on Wi-Fi P2P.
It also provides drag'n'drap operation similiar with the [Smartisan TNT Workstation](https://www.smartisan.com/tnt/overview).
It works on _Android_, _Windows_ and _MacOS_, theoretically.



## Environment

The Server(_Android_) part requires Nitrogen OS at API 28 (Android 9.0) with the customized Sensor OS pack, which enables controlling as well as processing drag'n'drop.
The Client(_Android_, _Windows_) part runs a Client APK or Win EXE.

## Features

### Magic Display

We create an illusory display at the beginning of the cast, then start our launcher on it.
It allows to display different apps on server and client.

### Wi-Fi P2P connection

Devices are connected by Wi-Fi P2P, which makes it possible to keep your own Wi-Fi connection, thus, the two devices can be connected to different APs, and without cutting out the existing connection, the two devices can be connected.

### Drag'n'drop

Drag'n'drop to share file to app, such as sending image to wechat friend, referring to [TNT intro on ytb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9bc2ko-a8k) or [TNT intro on bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av39075190) from 2:36 to 3:07.
